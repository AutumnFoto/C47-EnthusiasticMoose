# C47-EnthusiasticMoose
1st day of backend-
Exercise for practicing the basics of C#. We created a moose in the terminal that:

First: told use about himself
Second: asked question that a user was prompted to answer.
Third: The moose took the place of a magic 8 ball that would randomize an answer after a user asked the Moose.
